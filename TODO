. handle annotating errors better
. all data loaded from, and saved to, github
. translation service: [lemma] -> [translation]
 
. handle XML errors better


. morphology service: [morpheme] -> [[anotation]]
. drop down on lemma, > heirarchical menu, listing options from morphology service



. type-ahead for lemma
  should show brief definition in preview

. two blank fields at the bottom for arbitrary annotations
  hitting <enter> creates a new row, delete deletes the row



. rename index repository
. remove index on lemma by putting things in the .class attribute

. move submodules to resources/ dir
. figure out where to put views (.ejs extension works weirdly with maven layout)

. support ranges
